(** protobuf type system does not explicitely support standalone variant type since
    `one of` fields can only be within a `message` type. 

   However we support an optimization so that protobuf messages which only
   contain a single `one of` field are mapped to an OCaml variant rather 
   than a record with a single field of a variant type. This optimization allow
   cleaner and more consice generated code. 

   Therefore an OCaml variant can be encoded into 2 different way. Either it is 
   a standalone variant or it is actually part of a record. This information
   needs to be kept track of to generate the code accordingly.
